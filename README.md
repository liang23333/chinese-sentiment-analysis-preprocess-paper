      In this project,i study the effects of chinese preprocess to the accuracy of chinese 
    sentiment analysis.The preprocess operation consists of normalizing chinese-english 
    mixed text,replacing networds,replacing emoticons,removing stopwords,removing punctuations,
    removing links,removing numbers,replacing repeatwords.The classifiers i use in this paper 
    are Naive Bayes,Supporting vector machines,and two deep learning classifiers:Convolutional 
    Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network.
